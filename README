NotePadGPS - Remember Me
========================

Here you go my fellow coder:

New Android Programming Quest for these adventurers who like to start programming without a reason.

A new project must be created apart.

For those who want to code: NotePadGPSActivity.java is the file where you should start, any changes push them or contact: jose152 AT otfusion DOT org.


Actually the Map Activity will use the last known location first and then try to update it with the menu (no Icons for the menu options yet), I dont know if it should start listening as soon it starts the Activity, you know... battery usage and those things.

AT least, I hope you like our style.

Using:
- Locations api*
- Somekind of Notes application**
